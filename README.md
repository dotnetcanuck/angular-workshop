# angular-workshop

To create the Angular project, do the following:

1) Delete this file (`README.md`).

2) Run the following command in the directory containing this repository:

```
ng new angular-workshop --directory . --skip-git --skip-install
```

Deleting the README file is necessary because the Angular CLI will automatically generate a README, and will throw an error if one already exists.

Normally, just running `ng new my-project-name` is sufficient. But in this workshop, we already have our project directory and repository created, so we don't need the CLI to create them for us.
